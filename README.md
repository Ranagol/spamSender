Collecting email addresses

spamSender is an app that can be used by companies to collect, update, organize their lists of email addresses. Email adresses can be colllected either one-by-one, or in a string that contains possible couple of hundreds email adresses, amongst other gibberish text containing any text. The app is able to extract email adresses from this string. Email adresses could be separated possibly by whitespace, or ‘,’ or ‘;’ or something similar. The app will not allow duplicate emails.

The user can set every email address from default active (will receive emails) to not-active (will not receive emails).
